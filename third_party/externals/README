Subversion uses this directory to map in "external" repositories upon which
we depend.

To see the mappings, cd into this directory and then run:
svn propget svn:externals .

To modify the mappings, cd into this directory and run:
svn propedit svn:externals .

See http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.externals.html for
more info.


NOTE: We have disabled our use of these external dependencies, for now, because
they will fail for anyone using gclient to check out the skia code.  (As of
early 2011, gclient passes --ignore-externals when calling svn update.)  See
http://code.google.com/p/skia/issues/detail?id=291 and
https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-dev/browse_thread/thread/1f99541c2c5f6c6e

Leaving this directory (and unused external dependency on gyp) in place until
we figure out the long-term solution.  We may start using it again, or replace with
DEPS, or ???
