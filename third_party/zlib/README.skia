zlib-1.2.5
imported by epoger@google.com on 15 June 2011

Modifications from the stock distribution tar file:
- Addition of this README.skia file

All Skia-specific build glue is in zlib.gyp, which is not kept
in this directory.

I would have included this library via SVN externals like we do with "gyp",
but zlib source does not appear to be kept in a public source code control
system.
