libpng1.5.2
imported by epoger@google.com on 15 June 2011

Modifications from the stock distribution tar file:
- Addition of this README.skia file
- cp scripts/pnglibconf.h.prebuilt pnglibconf.h

All Skia-specific build glue is in libpng.gyp, which is not kept
in this directory.

I would have included this library via SVN externals like we do with "gyp",
but libpng source is kept in a git repository (not svn).
